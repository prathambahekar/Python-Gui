Application Overview

This is a GUI application built using PySide6, a Python binding for the Qt application framework. The application loads settings from a JSON file and applies them to the user interface.

Files and Modules

The application consists of the following files and modules:

ui_functions.py: This module contains utility functions for setting up and customizing the GUI.
ui_main.py: This module contains the UI definition for the main application window.
core.py: This module contains core application logic (not shown in the provided code snippet).
settings.json: This file contains application settings in JSON format.
main.py: This is the main application file, which initializes the application and sets up the GUI.
Main Application File (main.py)

The main application file, main.py, is responsible for initializing the application and setting up the GUI. Here's a breakdown of the code:

The first line imports the necessary modules: ui_functions for GUI utility functions, ui_main for the UI definition, and json for loading settings from the settings.json file.
The acess_settings variable is opened, and the Data variable is loaded with the contents of the settings.json file using the json.load() function.
The MainWindow class is defined, which inherits from QMainWindow. This class represents the main application window.
In the __init__ method, the QMainWindow constructor is called, and the ui attribute is set to an instance of Ui_MainWindow, which is the UI definition for the main window.
The setupUi method is called to set up the GUI, and the Setup_GUI function from ui_functions is called to apply settings to the GUI.
The show method is called to display the window, and the SetTheme function from ui_functions is called to set the theme for the application.
In the if __name__ == "__main__": block, the application is initialized by creating a QApplication instance and passing the command-line arguments to it. An instance of the MainWindow class is created, and the exec_ method is called to start the application's event loop.
Notes

This application uses PySide6, which is a Python binding for the Qt application framework.
The core module is not shown in the provided code snippet, but it is likely to contain core application logic.
The settings.json file is not shown in the provided code snippet, but it should contain application settings in JSON format.
